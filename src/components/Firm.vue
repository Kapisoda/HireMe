        <p>Far too long, professional-level treatments have been the privilege of the wealthy few. That's not right, and is's a situation that's changing as fast as our team tears down old-fashioned designs and creates new technologies at sensible prices for all.</p>
        <p>That's also why we're called FOREO, short for "For Every One." It's because we strive to create groundbraking, accessible solutions that bring happines and benefit to everyday lives.</p>
